# predicting-car-price-from-scraped-data
School Project

I scraped 32,000+ cars with 150 specifications from thecarconnection.com and ran multiple analyses with Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow. Those incluse PCA, fully-connected (dense) neural networks, decision trees, random forests, svm, etc.

- The specs scraper is [here](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/predicting-car-price-from-scraped-data/blob/master/scraping), but deprecated(it will only scrape 2,000 cars)
- The [image url scraper](https://github.com/nicolas-gervais/predicting-car-price-from-scraped-data/blob/master/image-scraper) is here
